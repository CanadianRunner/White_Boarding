Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

//Questions
Are you okay if I solve this in JavaScript?


function sortArray(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {  //loop to sort array
    for (let j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++)  //loop to check if 2nd # is greater than 1st #

    if(array[i] > array[j]) {      //if statement for 1st num > 2nd num then switch place
    let temporary = array[i];      // temp = 1st num
    array[i] = array[j];           // 1st num = 2nd num
    array[j] = temporary;          // 2nd num = 1st num
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
